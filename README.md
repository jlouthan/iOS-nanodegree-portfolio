# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Portfolio

The [iOS Developer Nanodegree offered by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003?v=ios1) is a self-paced comprehensive online course for people with programming experience to learn the fundamentals and beyond of iOS development in Swift. While the program is largely targeted at people hoping to start their career as an iOS developer, I enrolled in September 2015 as a side project while working full time in order to sharpen my iOS skills and learn something new. 

I completed all the material and "graduated" in November 2016. Below are links to the program's portfolio projects, in order of completion:
